Q:if i want to add message in one text, which parameter i should set in the function open in python
In Python, you can use the `mode` parameter of the `open()` function to set the file access mode. The file access mode specifies how the file will be used. To add a message to an existing text file, you should use the mode `'a'` (append mode) which will allow you to append text to the end of the file without overwriting any existing content. Here's an example code snippet:

```
with open('filename.txt', mode='a') as file:
    file.write('This is a new message that will be added to the end of the file')
```

In this code, you would replace `'filename.txt'` with the name and path of your actual text file, and you can change the message to whatever you need to add.Q:say this is a test
A:This is a test.Q:if i has already 'git add', but i want to rescind this operate, how can i do
A:To undo git add, you can use the command 'git reset'. You can use the following steps:

1. Open the terminal where you have the git repository.
2. Type 'git reset' command followed by the path of the file or directory that you want to unstage. For example, if you want to unstage a file named 'file1.txt', you can type the following command:

```
git reset file1.txt
```

3. If you want to unstage all the files that you have staged, you can type the following command:

```
git reset .
```

This command will unstage all the files that you have staged.
